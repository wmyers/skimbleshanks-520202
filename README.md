## Notes

Backend notes are [here](apps/backend/README.md). Also minor notes on using Zod schemas [here](apps/backend/src/shared/schemas/README.md).

Frontend notes are [here](apps/frontend/README.md). 

There are also a few comments added throughout the codebase(s).

The backend runs on port `3000`. The frontend on port `3001`. 

- Backend: http://localhost:3000/
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001/ (has redirect)

I haven't used `wait-on` or implemented a monorepo or some other technique to launch the apps, so just start the backend and then the frontend.
